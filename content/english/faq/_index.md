{{< faq "Is the venue accessible?" >}}
Yes, there are some steps to negotiate but if you let us know ahead of time we can assist.  
{{</ faq >}}

{{< faq "Is food and drink provided?" >}}
Yes! We provide pizza (with meat, vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free options) and a selection of drinks including alcoholic, non-alcoholic, fizzy juice and water. When signing up for a ticket, you'll be able to tell us your preferences.

{{< faq "Can I attend if I don't drink alcohol?" >}}
Absolutely. We always provide non-alcoholic options. While we do offer alcohol, it's completely optional and we aim to make the environment welcoming for everyone.

{{< faq "Why don’t you record or livestream the meetups?" >}}
We used to livestream meetups thanks to support from a third party, but we no longer have the resources to do this. As a volunteer-run group, we currently focus on delivering great in-person experiences. We're open to sponsorship or volunteer help if you'd like to support bringing recordings back!

{{< faq "What if I can't attend after I RSVP?" >}}
Please let us know as soon as possible if you can’t make it. We use RSVP numbers to order food and drink, so dropouts can lead to waste and unnecessary costs.

{{< faq "Can I help out or get involved?" >}}
We’re always looking for volunteers or companies that want to sponsor or support the group. Whether you want to help with logistics, speak at an event, or assist with streaming/recording — get in touch!

{{< faq "Do I need to be an Azure expert to attend?" >}}
Not at all! Our group welcomes everyone — from beginners exploring Azure for the first time to seasoned professionals. All you need is curiosity and a willingness to learn.

{{< faq "How is the group funded?" >}}
We're funded through generous sponsorship from companies who support our mission to bring the tech community together. That money goes towards food, drinks, and occasionally swag. We’re a non-profit, and every penny goes back into the group.
